On Designing A Questionnaire Based Legacy-UI Honeyword Generation Approach For Achieving Flatness

Abstract:

Modern trend sees a lot usage of honeywords (or fake password) for protecting the original passwords in the password file.However, the usage of honeywords has strongly been criticized under the di erent security and usability parameters. Though many of these issues have been successfully resolved, research in this domain is still facing di culties in achieving atness (or producing the equally probable honeywords with reference to the original password). Though recent studies have made a signi cant e ort to meet this criterion, we show that they either fall short or are based on some unrealistic assumptions. To practically ful l this atness criterion, we propose a questionnaire-oriented authentication system based on the episodic (or long term) memory of the users. Our study reveals that proposed mechanism is capable of generating signi cantly improved atter list of honeywords compared to the existing protocols. Subsequent discussion shows that the proposed system also overcomes all the limitations of the existing state of arts with no lesser than 95% goodness.
